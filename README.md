# ImageStacker
This is a simple libary/class that stacks images.

Just copy the sourcefiles in your project or add the CMakeLists.txt (CMake is not tested so you might want to change a few things in CMakeLists.txt) and you are ready to go (but remember that this projetct uses OpenCV 4.1.0)!
(You might also want to take a look at the liscence (GNU GPLv3).)

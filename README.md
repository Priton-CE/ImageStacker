# ImageStacker
This is a simple libary/class that stacks images.

----under development----

# Setup
Just copy the sourcefiles in your project or add the CMakeLists.txt and you are ready to go.
But remember that this projetct uses OpenCV 4.1.0 (and if you use CMake and are on Windows you might want to set the path to OpenCV manuelly. The variable is called "OpenCV_DIR" (e.g. "path/to/opencv/build/x64/vc15/lib"))!

(You might also want to take a look at the liscence (GNU GPLv3) if you are planning to upload your project with this libary as well.)
